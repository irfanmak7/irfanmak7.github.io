My most recent project here at Flatiron built upon my previous Rails project. The objective of this project was to add dynamic feature using JavaScript and JSON. I added the ability to load content onto the page without having to reload the page. Since the page no longer has to reload to show the content, it made the website feel quicker. Going into this project, I felt a bit overwhelmed. There are so many different ways to get data, such as getting a JSON data from a page. What helped me was to break the objectives down and tackle them one by one.

Here are a few keywords that are worth knowing for this project:

JSON

JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner giving us a human-readable collection of data.

JQUERY

jQuery is a Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation library. The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the elements of a Web page. jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements.

Javascript Model Object

I used a constructor function to create a Topic prototype object. The benefit of using a constructor is that it makes it easy to create multiple objects with the same properties and methods.
