Why did I decide to learn software development? Well, that's a good question. I have always been interested in how things work, especially computers and programs. My first experience with coding was back in high school where I took a basic computer science class. We were taught how to code in Java, it was very basic stuff. Fast forward to college where I took some more computer science classes and enjoyed writing code that turned into full programs. The feeling you get when your when your code translates into a program in undescribable. It is truly an amazing feeling. The process of coding is not an easy one. It requires a lot of planning and debugging to get your program to run properly. I like that it challenges me to think harder and find ways to solve errors. All the work put into coding is worth it at the end when you resolve all the issue in your code and have a fully running program. Then you can confidently say that you created a program from scratch. That feeling is why I decided to learn software development.
