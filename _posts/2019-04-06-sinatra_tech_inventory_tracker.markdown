Sinatra Portfolio Project

I have just finished my second project at Flatiron and I feel like I can code anything now.  I probably can’t but it feels great to finish a project and knowing that it works.  For this portfolio project, we had to create a MVC(Model-View-Controller) app using Sinatra, Active Record, Ruby, Sqlite3 and HTML.  I also used my very little knowledge on CSS to try and make things look nice.

For this project, I decided to the build a app that allows a user to track (not physical location) and manage all their tech devices.  This could be for a business to track their assets or simply for a household like mine that has tons of tech devices.  It allows someone to track what they own and the serial number for each device, since some devices either do not have it on the physical device or have to access it while the device is on and working.  If it not, then they’re out of luck.  Trust me, I’ve been that situation before.  I plan on expanding the features in the near future, but for now, the goal was to get a basic app up and functioning.

When it comes to creating something, especially an app, I am very scatter-brain.  To help with that, I write down or sketch out what I want to app to do and then figure out how I am going to implement that.  If you are like me, I suggest that you first write down your thoughts or sketch out a game plan before you start coding.

I enjoyed the process of the working on this project, mainly because of the visual aspect.  I’m a visual learner and being able to work with a browser and see the changes that I made, made debugging issues and testing the app much easier. 

At the end, it was a great process and enjoyed every bit off it. For anyone that is going to be creating similar project, go into it with confidence and a solid idea. If you want check out my app, here is a link to my Github: https://github.com/irfanmak7/tims_sinatra_portfolio_project.
