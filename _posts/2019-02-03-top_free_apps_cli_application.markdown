I have finally finished creating my Ruby CLI Data Gem project and it feels great!  After many hours and errors later, I have gotten the program running and looking the way I want it to. 

Just a little background on the project itself:  I had to create a CLI Gem Application using everything I have learn so far, from procedural Ruby to Object Oriented Ruby, creating a gem and using Github.  I had to scrape data from a website of my own choosing and use that data in my application. The application had to allow the user to go one level deep, which meant giving the user the ability to make a choice and see detailed infromation about their choice.

I had no clue on what website I would use. My first instinct was to find list of top restaurant/bars in my area but that was too similar to the examples that were used. My next choice was to use a video game critic site that listed the top video games but that site used javascript, so I couldn't use that either.  That same day, I was browsing through the App Store on my iPhone and thought that it would be cool if I could scrape the App Store for data and then realized that there had a to be website version of this. So after a Google search later, I was able to find the website version of the App Store and it was scrapable!

After a whole bunch of coffee and error later,  I had successfully created the application.  Here is a brief summary on how the application runs: you install and run the gem in your command line.  When you run it, you are greeted and provided a list of the top 100 apps on Apple's App Store. You are then given the option to select an app to get more information about it or quit the application. If you opt to get more information about the app, you simply enter the number of the app next to it. After you enter the number , it will show you details about that app such as category, developer name, rating, languages supported, and download size. After that, you can either get more information about another app on the list or exit out of the program

I felt super accomplished when I finally got the application running!  One piece of advice that I can give to someone who is new to programming is to take their time. Plan out how you want your application to work and write it down, like a blueprint. Once you know what you want your application to do, break it up into smaller parts. You can then start converting the smaller parts into code and begin building your application or program. It is definitely going to be frustrating at the beginning. Just take it easy and step away from your computer and take a breather and come back to it with a fresh mind.
